# 0x08. Making Change

## Description
This project focuses on solving the **coin change problem**, a classic challenge in the domain of **dynamic programming** and **greedy algorithms**. The objective is to determine the minimum number of coins required to achieve a given amount using a list of available coin denominations. 

The project reinforces understanding of:
- Algorithmic efficiency and problem-solving strategies.
- Implementation of both **greedy** and **dynamic programming** approaches.
- Handling edge cases effectively.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
1. Understand the differences between **greedy** and **dynamic programming** strategies.
2. Learn to analyze the **time and space complexity** of algorithms.
3. Improve your Python coding skills, including:
   - Efficient looping and conditional statements.
   - Use of list comprehensions and other data structures.
